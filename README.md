##Description
Generates a password composed of random english words (1-9 words). Other options include capitalizing the first character, adding a number at the end, adding a special character at the end.

##Details for instructor
Type a number from 1-9 to indicate the number of words to have in the password. I had each word separated by a hyphen so it was clear which english words were being used.
